## DESCRIPTION

Use SignalFx to monitor Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services through StackDriver monitoring. This integration enables data collection from all GCP web services that report to StackDriver.

## FEATURES

Connecting to GCP lets you take advantage of SignalFxâ€™s extensive GCP support.

- SignalFx can sync metadata about your GCP hosts to enrich metrics reported by StackDriver or the [SignalFx collectd agent](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/collectd-info.html).
- SignalFx provides built-in dashboards for many GCP services that report to StackDriver, such as [Google Compute Engine](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.google.compute.engine.html) and [Google Cloud Datastore](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.google.cloud.datastore.html).
