## USAGE

### Interpreting Built-in Dashboards

**Cloud Storage Bucket**

- **Requests / min** - Total rate of API calls on bucket.

- **Requests / min per Method** - Rate of API calls on bucket grouped by method.

- **2xx Requests** - Number of requests that responded with a 2xx response.

- **4xx Requests** - Number of requests that responded with a 4xx response.

- **5xx Requests** - Number of requests that responded with a 5xx response.

- **Sent Bytes** - Amount of bytes sent over the network by the bucket.

- **Sent Bytes / min per Method** - Amount of bytes sent over the network by the bucket aggregated by method.

- **Received Bytes** - Amount of bytes received over the network by the bucket.

- **Received Bytes / min per Method** - Amount of bytes received over the network by the bucket.

**Cloud Storage Overview**

- **Request Count / min** - Rate of total number of API calls.

- **Top Requests / min per Bucket** - Buckets with top 5 API calls.

- **Total Received Bytes** - Total bytes received by all buckets put together.

- **Received Bytes per Bucket** - Lists total bytes received by each bucket.

- **Total Sent Bytes** - Total bytes sent by all buckets put together.

- **Sent Bytes per Bucket** - Lists total bytes sent by each bucket.
